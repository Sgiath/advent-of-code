# Advent of Code — Agent Rules

This project contains Elixir solutions for Advent of Code. Your task is to produce correct, efficient implementations for each day.

## Core Requirements

* Every solution **must pass its tests**. Treat failing tests as invalid output.
* Prefer **clean, logically clear code** with comments describing the reasoning.
  Only sacrifice clarity when performance demands it.

## Running Tests

Use Elixir’s test runner.

* Run a single day:
  `mix test test/<year>/day<day>_test.exs`
* Run the full suite:
  `mix test`

All outputs you generate must satisfy these tests.

## Performance Expectations

Later puzzles (especially Part 2) may require optimized code.
To inspect hotspots, you can run:

```sh
mix advent_of_code.profile -y <year> -d <day> --part2
```

Use the results to refine algorithms and data structures, not just micro-optimize.

To see which solutions have the worst performance, you can run this command:

```sh
mix test --slowest 10 | tail -15  
```

## Input Data

You will usually find the example input embedded in the solution file for the day.

The real puzzle input is available here:

```
priv/<year>/day<day>.in
```

Always make sure your code handles both example and real inputs.
